In the Russian version, prepayments work in a different way compared to the standard version of [!INCLUDE[prodshort](../../includes/prodshort.md)]. When we receive a prepayment, it is necessary by accounting rules to post prepayment on separate account, that way Vendor and Customer Posting groups have field - Prepayment Account

[!INCLUDE[prodshort](../../includes/prodshort.md)] uses this accounts for prepayment entries- Payment with Prepayment check mark.

## Posting a prepayment
